# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub. It will hopefully print Hello World.

Hello there,

I'm Fabio Craig Wimmer Florey, I work as an Identity and Access Management Consultant for Beta 80 Group S.P.A.
I'm 28 and I live in Milan, Italy. I'm trying to be better in Python, VBA and Perl6.

Have a nice day.
